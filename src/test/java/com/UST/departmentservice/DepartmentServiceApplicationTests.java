Based on the given code, it appears to be written in a version of Java that supports JUnit 5 and Spring Boot. To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we'll need to modify the code slightly.

Here's the modified code for Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentServiceApplicationTests {

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
	}

}
```

No changes are required for this code to be compatible with Java 17 as it is already using the required dependencies and annotations.

Please note that this code assumes that the required dependencies for JUnit 5 and Spring Boot are correctly configured in your project. Make sure to update your build file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle) to include the necessary dependencies if needed.
