The provided code snippet is written in YAML, not Java. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language commonly used for configuration files.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we would need the corresponding Java code. If you have a Java code snippet that needs to be upgraded, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
