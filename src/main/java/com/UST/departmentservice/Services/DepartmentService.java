The given Java code is written in a version earlier than Java 8. The code uses Spring Framework annotations and relies on autowiring for dependency injection.

Here's the upgraded code compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.Services;

import com.UST.departmentservice.Model.Department;
import com.UST.departmentservice.Repository.DepartmentRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class DepartmentService {
    private final DepartmentRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public DepartmentService(DepartmentRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }

    public Department saveDepartment(Department department) {
        return repo.save(department);
    }

    public Department findDepartmentById(Long departmentId) {
        return repo.findByDepartmentId(departmentId);
    }
}
```

In the modified code, the following changes are made:

1. Introduced constructor-based dependency injection instead of field injection. This is because field injection with `@Autowired` is no longer the recommended practice.
2. Made the `repo` field `final` to ensure immutability.
3. Removed redundant `@Autowired` annotation on the `repo` field.
4. Updated the constructor to take a `DepartmentRepository` parameter for dependency injection.
5. Updated the return type of the `saveDepartment` and `findDepartmentById` methods to `Department` (assumed based on the code logic).

These changes conform to the best practices and standards of Java 17 and promote better code readability, maintainability, and testability.
