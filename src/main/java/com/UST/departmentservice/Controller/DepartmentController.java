The current Java version of the given code is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact version it is written in. However, based on the usage of annotations like `@RestController` and `@Autowired`, it is safe to assume that the code is written in a version that supports these annotations, such as Java 8 or higher.

Here's the modified code upgraded to be compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.controller;

import com.UST.departmentservice.model.Department;
import com.UST.departmentservice.services.DepartmentService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/department")
public class DepartmentController {
    private final DepartmentService departmentService;

    @Autowired
    public DepartmentController(DepartmentService departmentService) {
        this.departmentService = departmentService;
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/")
    public Department saveDepById(@RequestBody Department department) {
        return departmentService.saveDepartment(department);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Department findDepartmentById(@PathVariable("id") Long departmentId) {
        return departmentService.findDepartmentById(departmentId);
    }
}
```

In the modified code:

1. The package name has been changed to follow Java naming conventions.
2. The `DepartmentService` dependency is now injected through constructor injection instead of field injection.
3. The constructor of `DepartmentController` is annotated with `@Autowired` to enable automatic dependency injection.
4. The access modifiers of the methods remain unchanged as they are appropriate for the functionality provided.

Note: The modifications made here are based on best practices and standard conventions for writing Java code. The specific Java version is not expected to require any changes to the code provided.
