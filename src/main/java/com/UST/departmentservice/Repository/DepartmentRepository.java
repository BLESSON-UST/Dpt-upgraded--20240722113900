The current Java version of the code is not explicitly specified, but based on the usage of Spring Data JPA and the code syntax, it appears to be written in Java 8 or a previous version.

Here's the modified code compatible with Java 17, incorporating new features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.ust.departmentservice.repository;

import com.ust.departmentservice.model.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    Department findByDepartmentId(Long departmentId);
}
```

Note that the changes made to the code are minimal as there are no specific new language features or best practices introduced in Java 17 that directly affect this code snippet.
